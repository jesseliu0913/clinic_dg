In several researches in the literature, SP fracture was reported in patients with the Eagle\u2019s syndrome (4, 6, 7). Elongated SP and mineralized SC are more susceptible to sudden fracture after a mild injury. Eagle described a traumatic elongation of SP due to tonsillectomy with or without resulting fracture. This type of Eagle\u2019s syndrome is characterized by otalgia, ipsilateral cervicofacial pain, dysphagia, foreign body sensation in the throat, trismus and tinnitus (6). The proximity of important anatomical structures like the internal carotid artery, vagus, and facial nerves reveals the clinical importance of this bony process (3). The styloid process fracture may cause serious life threatening problems or difficulty in treatment of associated fractures. Dislocation of the fractured SP sometimes complicates the management of facial fractures. Gulicher and Gerlach reported a case of mandibular fracture that failed to be reduced because of SP fracture (8). The diagnosis of SP fracture is based on radiographic examination combined with the history of a traumatic injury and symptoms mentioned by the patient. Various signs and symptoms related to the SP fracture have been reported in the literature. Pharyngeal and diffuse facial pains are usually the chief complaints (9). These patients usually have a clinical history of trauma to the face or neck, although sudden fracture of elongated SP has been reported in several studies (4). Limitation in mandibular movements and dysphagia are other common symptoms (4). In some cases, the presentation of SP fracture resembles the symptoms and signs of TMD (2, 5). Atsu et al in 2006 reported a case revealing spontaneous TMD and SP fracture (2). They concluded that exact examination and history taking of the patient help the clinician distinguish these two problems from one another. The patients with SP fracture occasionally sense a foreign body in the throat and discomfort during head turning (4). Although the patient experienced pain during mastication, the mandibular movements were without any limitation and there was no preauricular pain during the examination. The latter symptoms combined with a history of trauma clued us to suspect SP fracture. The styloid process fracture was obvious on CT views. Similar symptoms of orofacial pains from different sources, i.e. TMD and especially glossopharyngeal neuralgia are two important conditions, which may resemble the signs and symptoms of SP fracture (5). Pre-auricular pain and limitation of mandibular movements are the most frequent signs and symptoms and the usual chief complaints in TMD patients (1). The clinical importance of TMD is its early diagnosis and preventing the progression of symptoms and worsening of the patients\u2019 conditions. Early diagnosis of TMD is sometimes difficult due to the similarity of this problem to other maxillofacial pains (9). The origin and distribution of the pain in patients with TMD are sometimes similar to other causes of oral and maxillofacial pain. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is a facial pain syndrome characterized by deep pain on one side of the throat extending to the ear (10). The pain distribution and symptoms of this neuralgia is similar to the symptoms of SP fracture and is sometimes confusing. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is characterized by intermittent paroxysmal attacks usually lasting shorter than two minutes (10). The nature of the attacks is unilateral, sharp and severely painful. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia can be associated with bradycardia and asystole, which helps distinguish GPN from SP fracture (10).', {'content': 'The management of SP fracture depends on the severity and displacement of the fracture (5) and the amount of the fractured SP displacement (5). Surgical removal of the SP may be necessary when either the SP is elongated or severely displaced (5). In some other cases which SP fracture is associated with other facial bone fractures, it may not be possible to reduce fractures without performing surgery. In an SP fracture with mild discomfort, conservative treatments may be appropriate and sufficient. In our case, we administered muscle relaxant agents to lessen muscle tonicity and reduce patient discomfort during head turning. The patient was ordered to limit his neck movements for several weeks to give a chance to heal the fracture site. In conclusion SP fracture mimicking orofacial pain, particularly TMD is a diagnostic challenge and physicians should be aware of its signs and symptoms to prevent misdiagnosis and mismanagement.'}",
