    "Case 1": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I'm feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please tell me a little about yourself and any medical conditions or allergies you might have?\n\nPatient: I'm a 36-year-old male with no underlying medical conditions or allergies. I received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Cominarty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) at a tertiary hospital in Malaysia.\n\nDoctor: When did you first notice the symptoms related to your eyes?\n\nPatient: I experienced some distortion in both eyes and general body aches about three hours after the vaccination.\n\nDoctor: How did the symptoms progress after they started?\n\nPatient: My body aches and back pain went away after one day. The distortion in my right eye was gone after three days, but it’s still there in my left eye.\n\nDoctor: When did you come to the ophthalmology clinic for these eye symptoms?\n\nPatient: I came to the clinic 10 days after the vaccination because the issue in my left eye was still there.\n\nDoctor: Did you have any eye problems before this?\n\nPatient: No, I hadn't had any eye problems before this episode.\n\nDoctor: How are you managing with the distortion still in your left eye?\n\nPatient: The distortion in my left eye is still there.\n\nDoctor: Did you have any symptoms like a cough, fever, or respiratory illness before or after your vaccination?\n\nPatient: No symptoms like a cough, respiratory illness, or fever occurred before or after my vaccination.\n\nDoctor: Your eye scans show a yellowish elevation at the fovea with some changes in the retinal layer, but there's no fluid under it.\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds a bit concerning. What does it mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: The good news is that tests 15 days after vaccination showed clinical improvement. The elevation at the fovea had reduced in size, which matches the reduction in your symptoms. However, some changes are still visible on the scans.\n\nPatient: That's reassuring. Should I be doing anything specific to help the healing process?\n\nDoctor: We obtained detailed eye imaging that showed some changes at the left fovea affecting the photoreceptor layer.\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: The imaging shows some lesions at the fovea, corresponding to where we observed them during the eye exam.\n\nPatient: I did notice a slight change in my central vision. Is this something serious?\n\nDoctor: These findings suggest acute retinal pigment epithelitis (ARPE).\n\nPatient: I see. Will it resolve on its own, or will I need treatment?\n\nDoctor: We believe your eye symptoms might be related to the vaccine. Because of this, you chose not to get the second vaccine dose.\n\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.",
    "Case 2": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I'm feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please tell me a little about yourself, including any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: I'm a 68-year-old Malay man.\n\nDoctor: Can you describe when you first noticed any issues with your vision after the vaccination?\n\nPatient: I experienced sudden-onset blurring of vision in my right eye three days after receiving my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Cominarty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nDoctor: Did you have any similar symptoms after your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nPatient: No, I didn’t have any vision problems after my first dose.\n\nDoctor: Do you have any previous eye conditions or other medical illnesses that could be related to this recent experience?\n\nPatient: No, I don't have any underlying medical illnesses or significant past eye problems.\n\nDoctor: The OCT examination showed a loss of foveal contour with intraretinal and subretinal fluid, along with a fibrovascular pigment epithelial defect.\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: The OCT macula revealed that the intraretinal fluids have resolved, but the subretinal fluid remains the same size, and the fibrovascular PED is more defined.\n\nPatient: It's a relief to hear some things are improving, but should I be worried about the subretinal fluid or the more defined defect?\n\nDoctor: Your visual acuity was 6/12 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left. The anterior segment examination was unremarkable. The fundus examination showed an orange-round lesion at the macula and hemorrhagic changes, but there was no drusen or evidence of age-related macular degeneration or any myopic changes.\n\nPatient: Alright, I understand. Can you tell me what this might mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: The orange-round lesion and hemorrhagic changes at the macula could be affecting your right eye's vision, which is why your visual acuity is 6/12 OD.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. Is this something that could get worse over time?\n\nDoctor: Since there's no evidence of age-related macular degeneration or myopic changes, the issue doesn't seem related to those common conditions. However, monitoring the lesion and hemorrhagic changes is essential to prevent any potential worsening.\n\nPatient: I see. What steps can we take to monitor or treat it?\n\nDoctor: Further evaluation and possibly imaging studies might help us understand the nature and cause of the lesion and the hemorrhagic changes. This will inform any treatment options or need for frequent monitoring.\n\nPatient: Thanks for explaining. Let's proceed with the necessary next steps.\n\nDoctor: Will do. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.",
    "Case 3": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please share a little about yourself? Do you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: I'm a 50-year-old Malay woman with no underlying medical illnesses. I experienced blurring of vision in both eyes two weeks after receiving my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nDoctor: When did you first notice the symptoms related to your vision?\n\nPatient: My vision started to blur about a week after the vaccination, and it hasn't improved since then.\n\nDoctor: Can you describe any noticeable changes or symptoms related to your eyes?\n\nPatient: The examination of the front part of my eyes was normal, with no signs of inflammation.\n\nDoctor: The fundus photo and OCT scan of your macula showed bilateral placoid lesions in the choroid with macular edema.\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: Fortunately, the latest fundus photo and OCT scan show resolution of the placoid lesions and macular edema one week after we started treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone.\n\nPatient: That's a relief to hear. So the treatment is working well, then?\n\nDoctor: The examination of the back part of your eyes initially showed bilateral fibrinous placoid lesions in the choroid with severe macular edema.\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. Can you tell me more about what this means for my vision?\n\nDoctor: We diagnosed your condition as acute multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy based on our clinical and investigation findings.\n\nPatient: I’ll follow up as needed. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.",
    "Case 4": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?  \nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.  \n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please tell me a little about yourself and any medical conditions or allergies you might have?  \nPatient: I'm a 32-year-old Malay woman, a housewife with a history of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression.  \n\nDoctor: When did you first notice any symptoms after receiving the vaccine?  \nPatient: Two weeks after my vaccination, I developed multiple skin rashes, vesicles, and crusty lesions on the right side of my face, respecting the midline and involving the tip of my nose.  \n\nDoctor: Did you experience any eye-related issues after the rash appeared?  \nPatient: A week later, I suddenly developed redness, itchiness, and mild blurring of vision in my right eye.  \n\nDoctor: Were there any other symptoms you noticed during this time?  \nPatient: I also had right periorbital swelling, but it resolved after two days.  \n\nDoctor: Do you have a history of similar symptoms or conditions in the past?  \nPatient: I've never had symptoms like this before, aside from my mental health conditions.  \n\nDoctor: I see. Are you experiencing any other symptoms now?  \nPatient: No, I'm not.  \n\nDoctor: That's a good sign. There doesn't seem to be anything major to worry about at the moment.  \n\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief to hear. Thank you for explaining that.  \n\nDoctor: Your visual acuity was 6/12 unaided and 6/6 with a pinhole for both eyes.  \nPatient: So my vision is almost normal with some aid?  \n\nDoctor: Yes, during the ocular examination, there was a circumciliary injection in your right eye.  \nPatient: What does a circumciliary injection mean for my eye health?  \n\nDoctor: It indicates some inflammation around the cornea, but the anterior chamber showed cell activity at 2+ with no keratic precipitates, hypopyons, or fibrinous reactions.  \nPatient: Does the cell activity indicate any serious condition to worry about?  \n\nDoctor: No, and the fundus examination was otherwise unremarkable, with a normal optic disc and macula.  \nPatient: That's a relief to hear that everything else seems normal.  \n\nDoctor: There was no evidence of posterior segment inflammation such as vitritis, retinitis, choroiditis, or vasculitis.  \nPatient: I’m glad there’s no inflammation in the back of my eye. So, what should I do next?  \n\nDoctor: Just continue monitoring your symptoms.  \n\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.  \n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns."
