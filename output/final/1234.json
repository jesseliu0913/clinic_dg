    "Case 1": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please tell me a little about yourself and if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: I'm a 36-year-old male with no medical conditions or allergies. I received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Cominarty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) at a tertiary hospital in Malaysia.\n\nDoctor: When did you first notice any symptoms related to your eyes?\n\nPatient: I started experiencing both-sided metamorphopsia and general body aches about 3 hours after the vaccination.\n\nDoctor: How did your symptoms progress in the days following the vaccination?\n\nPatient: My body aches and back pain went away after a day, and the metamorphopsia in my right eye improved after 3 days, but the issue in my left eye is still there.\n\nDoctor: Did you have any other symptoms besides those related to your eyes and body aches?\n\nPatient: I didn't have any eye pain, redness, or sensitivity to light. I also didn't have any symptoms like cough, fever, or other flu-like symptoms before or after the vaccination.\n\nDoctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since they first appeared?\n\nPatient: After 15 days, the metamorphopsia in my left eye improved a bit, though it's still present. My vision has also improved to 6/6 in both eyes.\n\nDoctor: Considering your symptoms, what did you decide about your vaccination schedule?\n\nPatient: We figured the eye symptoms might be related to the vaccine, so I opted not to get the second dose.\n\nDoctor: Have you noticed any pain or redness in your eyes with your current symptoms?\n\nPatient: No, there's no pain, redness, or sensitivity to light in my eyes.\n\nDoctor: Did you experience any other symptoms, like a cough or fever, around the time of your vaccination?\n\nPatient: No, I didn't have any symptoms like a cough, upper respiratory tract illness, or fever before or after getting vaccinated.\n\n**Round 1:**\n\nDoctor: We took some tests at 10 days post-vaccination. There was a yellowish raised area in your left eye and some changes at the fovea. No subretinal fluid was found.\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What does the elevation mean for my vision?\n\n**Round 2:**\n\nDoctor: At 15 days post-vaccination, the elevated lesion at the fovea had reduced in size, aligning with your symptom improvement.\n\nPatient: I'm relieved to hear there’s some improvement. How long does recovery usually take?\n\n**Round 3:**\n\nDoctor: The OCT showed the lesion is still present, with some changes in your eye's imaging.\n\nPatient: So, there's still some healing to do. Should I follow any specific precautions in the meantime?\n\nDoctor: Your initial uncorrected visual acuity was 6/12 in both eyes.\n\nPatient: Oh, I noticed my vision was not as sharp as before.\n\nDoctor: With correction, your best visual acuity improved to 6/6 in both eyes.\n\nPatient: That's good to hear. I feel like my eyesight improves with correction.\n\nDoctor: The left-eye metamorphopsia was noted on the Amsler chart, particularly in the central and paracentral areas.\n\nPatient: Yes, I've noticed some distortion when I look at certain patterns.\n\nDoctor: The fundus examination showed a well-defined, yellowish raised area above the fovea in your left eye.\n\nPatient: I wasn't aware of that. Is it causing the visual changes I'm experiencing?\n\nDoctor: The imaging showed some activity in the fovea that matches the fundus findings and OCT images.\n\nPatient: Interesting. Does this mean there’s any serious issue I should be concerned about?\n\nDoctor: No, there's no serious issue to be worried about right now.\n\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.",
    "Case 2": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Could you please tell me a little about yourself, and if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: I'm a 68-year-old Malay man.\n\nDoctor: When did you first start experiencing the blurring of your vision?\n\nPatient: I noticed the sudden blurring in my right eye three days after receiving my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nDoctor: Have you had any previous eye issues or underlying health conditions that might be relevant?\n\nPatient: I don't have any underlying medical conditions and no significant history with my eyes.\n\nDoctor: Did you notice any eye symptoms after your first dose of the vaccine?\n\nPatient: No, I didn’t experience any eye symptoms after the first dose.\n\nDoctor: Have you experienced any other health symptoms recently?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nDoctor: There was no sign of age-related macular degeneration or myopic changes. The OCT scan showed a loss of the foveal contour with intraretinal and subretinal fluid and a fibrovascular pigment epithelial defect.\n\nPatient: Oh, I see. That sounds quite serious. What does this mean for my vision?\n\n---\n\nDoctor: After an intravitreal ranibizumab injection a week later, your right-eye vision remained at 6/12.\n\nPatient: So, the treatment helped a bit, but my vision hasn't changed much. Do I need to continue with more injections?\n\n---\n\nDoctor: The OCT scan showed the intraretinal fluids had resolved; however, the subretinal fluid remained the same size, and the fibrovascular PED is now more defined.\n\nPatient: It's good that some fluid resolved, but it seems like there's still an issue with that subretinal fluid. What are our next steps?\n\nDoctor: Your visual acuity was 6/12 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left. The front part of your eye looked normal, but the fundus examination revealed an orange-round lesion at the macula.\n\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, there’s something unusual with the macula in my right eye?\n\nDoctor: Yes, that’s correct. This could explain why your vision isn’t as sharp in your right eye. We'll need to examine that lesion further.\n\nPatient: Understood. Is it something I should be worried about?\n\nDoctor: At this stage, we're unsure of the cause. The fact that the front part of your eye is healthy is a good sign. We just need to keep monitoring that macular lesion.\n\nPatient: Got it. I'll follow the next steps you recommend.\n\nDoctor: Great. If you have any more concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.\n\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, Doctor.",
    "Case 3": "Certainly, let's make the conversation more natural and clear:\n\n---\n\nDoctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please tell me a little about yourself? Do you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: I'm a 50-year-old Malay woman with no underlying medical issues. I experienced blurring of vision in both eyes two weeks after receiving my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nDoctor: When did you first notice the blurring of vision?\n\nPatient: It started a week after the vaccination and hasn't improved since.\n\nDoctor: What was your visual acuity like initially?\n\nPatient: My visual acuity was 6/18 in the right eye and 6/12 in the left eye.\n\nDoctor: What changes did you notice during your follow-up regarding your eyes?\n\nPatient: Four days later, both the macula edema and placoid lesions resolved.\n\nDoctor: How long did it take for your symptoms to improve after treatment?\n\nPatient: A week after receiving intravenous methylprednisolone, my symptoms improved completely.\n\nDoctor: What was your visual acuity and eye health like after your symptoms improved?\n\nPatient: My vision was 6/6 in both eyes, with no signs of macula edema or placoid lesions, both clinically and on imaging.\n\nDoctor: Have you experienced any recent symptoms like changes in vision, body aches, or other discomforts?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't.\n\nDoctor: Initially, fundus photos and OCT showed placoid lesions and macula edema. \n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: After treatment, these placoid lesions and macula edema resolved.\n\nPatient: That's a relief! So, the treatment worked?\n\nDoctor: Yes, your anterior segment examination showed no signs of inflammation.\n\nPatient: That’s good to hear; at least there's nothing wrong in that part of my eyes.\n\nDoctor: The posterior segment showed fibrinous placoid lesions in the choroid with severe macula edema.\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: Visual and optic nerve conduction tests were normal.\n\nPatient: I'm relieved to know there’s no issue with my optic nerve and visual pathways.\n\nDoctor: Systemic examination results were unremarkable.\n\nPatient: It’s a relief that there’s nothing else going wrong with my body besides my eyes.\n\nDoctor: We diagnosed you with acute multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy based on the findings.\n\nPatient: I’ll follow the advice. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care and feel free to reach out if you have more concerns.",
    "Case 4": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please share a little about yourself and let me know if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: I'm a 32-year-old Malay woman, a housewife, with a history of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. I received my first dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nDoctor: When did you first start noticing symptoms related to your skin and face?\n\nPatient: Two weeks after the vaccination, I developed multiple skin rashes, vesicles, and crusty lesions on the right side of my face, affecting my nose but not crossing the midline.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about when and how your eye symptoms started?\n\nPatient: A week after the rash appeared, I suddenly had redness, itchiness, and mild blurring of vision in my right eye.\n\nDoctor: Did you experience any other symptoms or changes that resolved on their own?\n\nPatient: Yes, there was some swelling around my right eye that went down after two days.\n\nDoctor: Have you experienced any symptoms or changes in your health recently?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't noticed anything new.\n\nDoctor: Your visual acuity was 6/12 unaided and 6/6 with a pinhole vision test in both eyes.\n\nPatient: So, my vision is pretty good with correction, right?\n\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct. The eye examination showed a circumciliary injection in your right eye.\n\nPatient: I noticed some redness in my right eye, so that makes sense.\n\nDoctor: The examination also revealed cell activity in the anterior chamber without any keratic precipitates, hypopyons, or fibrinous reactions.\n\nPatient: I've been feeling some discomfort. That explains the irritation.\n\nDoctor: The fundus examination was otherwise unremarkable, with normal optic disc and macula.\n\nPatient: That's a relief to hear that everything looks normal in the back of my eye.\n\nDoctor: There was no evidence of posterior segment inflammation such as vitritis, retinitis, choroiditis, or vasculitis.\n\nPatient: Good to know there isn't inflammation in the back part of my eye, thank you.\n\nDoctor: You were treated for underlying herpes zoster infection with acute nongranulomatous anterior uveitis in your right eye. The diagnosis was made clinically. You were given oral acyclovir and topical tobramycin with dexamethasone for the right eye. Following treatment, the uveitis and skin lesions improved by two weeks and completely resolved at your 1-month follow-up.\n\nPatient: Got it. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns."
