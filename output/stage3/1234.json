    "Case 1": "Certainly, let's improve the dialogue to enhance natural flow and coherence:\n\n---\n\nDoctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please share a little about yourself, and if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: Well, [‘A 36-year-old male doctor with no underlying medical illness or allergies was administered the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia.’]\n\nDoctor: Alright, thanks for sharing that. When did you first notice the symptoms related to your eyes?\n\nPatient: [He claimed to have bilateral metamorphopsia with generalized body aches about 3 h postvaccination.] Actually, it started...\n\nDoctor: I understand. Can you tell me more about how these eye symptoms progressed over time?\n\nPatient: Sure, [His myalgia and backache resolved after 1 day, and his right eye metamorphosia resolved after 3 days.] and then it continued...\n\nDoctor: Did you experience any other symptoms accompanying your eye problems?\n\nPatient: Yes, [No viral-like illness or symptoms, such as cough, upper respiratory tract illness, or fever, were reported before or after his vaccination.] were quite noticeable.\n\nDoctor: I see. How has your left eye metamorphopsia been since the initial onset?\n\nPatient: Well, [Although it was still present, the symptoms had reduced in intensity, and the visual acuity had improved to 6/6 OU.] and it fluctuates sometimes.\n\nDoctor: I see. Did you make any decisions regarding your vaccination after relating the symptoms to it?\n\nPatient: Yes, [We diagnosed his ocular symptoms as possibly vaccine-related, and our patient subsequently opted not to continue with the second dose of his vaccine.] made me think carefully about it.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Have you experienced any pain, redness, or sensitivity to light in your eyes recently?\n\nPatient: Actually, [There was no eye pain, redness, or photophobia in either eye.] although it was mild.\n\nDoctor: Alright, have you noticed any symptoms of a viral-like illness, such as a cough, or fever, either before or after your vaccination?\n\nPatient: Yes, [No viral-like illness or symptoms, such as cough, upper respiratory tract illness, or fever, were reported before or after his vaccination.] which was a bit worrying.\n\nDoctor: Let’s take a look at [There is left eye yellowish raised elevation and hyperautofluorescence at the fovea with dome-shaped elevation of the RPE at the fovea causing disruption of the ellipsoid zone.].\n\nPatient: Oh, I wasn't aware of these specific details about my eye. What does this elevation at the fovea mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: Well, [(B) Fundus photograph, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) of the same patient at 15 days post vaccination showed improvement clinically.] indicates some changes.\n\nPatient: That's good to hear that there's improvement. Will the remaining lesion on the OCT eventually go away too?\n\nDoctor: Likely, [The refractive assessment showed bilateral low myope of −0.75D and mild astigmatism of −0.25D in the left eye, with a normal amplitude of accommodation 7.5D OU.] but it might take some time.\n\nPatient: That seems like a slight change in my vision. Does the low myopia or astigmatism affect me significantly?\n\nDoctor: Generally, [Left-eye metamorphopsia was noted on the Amsler chart, mostly around the central and paracentral regions.] it shouldn’t be too concerning.\n\nPatient: I noticed some distortion with my left eye; is that what metamorphopsia is?\n\nDoctor: Exactly, [The anterior segment examination via slit lamp biomicroscopy was unremarkable.] describes just that.\n\nPatient: It's good to know there's no inflammation. Does that mean my eyes are generally healthy?\n\nDoctor: Yes, [Fundus examination of the left eye showed a well-circumscribed, yellowish-raised elevation superior to the fovea.] they are in good condition.\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What does a raised elevation near the fovea indicate?\n\nDoctor: It usually means [ICGA showed hypocyanescence at the corresponding area on the fovea, with a hypocyanescent area noted at the inferonasal vessel arcade in the venous phase.] which we'll monitor closely.\n\nPatient: It sounds like there is some improvement, but what is a pigment epithelial defect, and should I be worried about it?\n\nDoctor: No, [‘$No$’] you shouldn't be too worried.\n\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.\n\n--- \n\nThis version of the dialogue includes phrases and conjunctions to create a more natural and flowing conversation between the doctor and patient.",
    "Case 2": "Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor: I see. Could you please share a little about yourself, and if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm ['A 68-year-old Malay man.']\n\nDoctor: Thanks for sharing that. Could you describe when you first experienced any issues with your vision after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination?\n\nPatient: [A 68-year-old Malay man presented with sudden-onset right-eye central blurring of vision 3 days after receiving his second dose of COVID-19 vaccination (Cominarty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech).]\n\nDoctor: Alright, before the second dose, did you have any medical conditions or previous eye issues that might have contributed to this?\n\nPatient: [He had no underlying medical illness and no significant past ocular history.]\n\nDoctor: I understand. After your first dose of the vaccine, did you notice any similar ocular symptoms or was this something new?\n\nPatient: [He did not have any ocular symptoms after his first dose of the vaccine.]\n\nDoctor: Okay, have you experienced any symptoms following your recent vaccination?\n\nPatient: [$No$]\n\nDoctor: Let's take a look at this image, [Ocular coherence tomography (Topcon Spectral Domain OCT) showed loss of foveal contour with the presence of intraretinal and subretinal fluid, and a fibrovascular pigment epithelial defect (Figure 2A).].\n\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, there’s no sign of macular degeneration or myopic changes, but there are some issues with fluid and a defect?\n\nDoctor: Yes, exactly, [OCT macula revealed resolution of intraretinal fluids; however, the subretinal fluid was similar in size and the fibrovascular PED was more defined (Figure 2B).].\n\nPatient: Thanks for explaining that. It’s good to know the intraretinal fluid is resolved, but I’m concerned about the subretinal fluid and the more defined fibrovascular PED.\n\nDoctor: That's a valid concern. Let's discuss further, [His presenting visual acuity was 6/12 OD and 6/6 OS.].\n\nPatient: Okay, so my right eye isn't seeing as well as my left, and there's a lesion in the macula?\n\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct, [His presenting visual acuity was 6/12 OD and 6/6 OS.].\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand. What does the lesion mean for my vision in the future?\n\nDoctor: Well, the situation is still being monitored, and currently, there are no specific answers, ['$No$\"'].\n\nPatient: Will do.

What treatment were you given, and how did it affect your symptoms?\n\nPatient: [A week after being given intravenous methylprednisolone, her symptoms resolved.]\n\nDoctor: So, how is your visual acuity and overall eye health now?\n\nPatient: [Her visual acuity was 6/6 OU, with no macula edema or placoid lesions seen both clinically and on ocular imaging (Figure 3B).]\n\nDoctor: Are you currently experiencing any symptoms or discomfort related to your health?\n\nPatient: [$No$]\n\nDoctor: I see. Let's take a look at [(A)Fundus photo and OCT macula showing bilateral placoid lesions in the choroid with macula edema on presentation.].\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: [(B)Fundus photo and OCT macula showing resolution of bilateral placoid lesions and macula edema one week post-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone.]\n\nPatient: That's a relief to hear. So, the treatment is working well, right?\n\nDoctor: [The anterior segment examination was unremarkable, with no evidence of anterior segment inflammation.]\n\nPatient: That's good to hear. I was worried about possible inflammation.\n\nDoctor: [Posterior segment examination showed bilateral fibrinous placoid lesions in the choroid with severe inner and outer macula edema (Figure 3A).]\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: [Visual evoked potential and optic nerve conduction studies were normal.]\n\nPatient: So, thankfully, that means my optic nerve is functioning properly, right?\n\nDoctor: [The systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable.]\n\nPatient: I'm relieved to hear that nothing else seems to be out of the ordinary.
