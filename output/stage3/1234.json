    "Case 1": "\n        Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n        Patient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\n        Doctor: I see, Could you please share a little about yourself, and if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n        Patient: ['A 36-year-old male doctor with no underlying medical illness or allergies was administered the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Cominarty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia.']\n        Doctor: When did you first notice the symptoms related to your eyes?  \nPatient: ['He claimed to have bilateral metamorphopsia with generalized body aches about 3 h postvaccination.']  \n\nDoctor: How did the symptoms progress after the initial onset?  \nPatient: ['His myalgia and backache resolved after 1 day, and his right eye metamorphosia resolved after 3 days.', 'However, the metamorphopsia in his left eye persisted.']  \n\nDoctor: When did you seek medical help at the ophthalmology clinic for these symptoms?  \nPatient: ['He presented to the ophthalmology clinic with left eye metamorphopsia 10 days after vaccination.']  \n\nDoctor: Did you have any eye-related symptoms before this episode?  \nPatient: ['Prior to this episode, he did not have any ocular symptoms.']  \n\nDoctor: How are you feeling now with the metamorphopsia still present in your left eye?  \nPatient: ['However, the metamorphopsia in his left eye persisted.']  Doctor: Did you experience any symptoms such as cough, fever, or upper respiratory tract illness before or after your vaccination?  \nPatient: ['No viral-like illness or symptoms, such as cough, upper respiratory tract illness, or fever, were reported before or after his vaccination.']Doctor: ['(A)Fundus photograph, autofluorescence and ocular coherence tomography findings at 10 days post vaccination.', 'There is left eye yellowish raised elevation and hyperautofluorescence at the fovea with dome-shaped elevation of the RPE at the fovea causing disruption of the ellipsoid zone.', 'No subretinal fluid was noted.']\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds a bit concerning. What does it mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: ['(B)Fundus photograph, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) of the same patient at 15 days post vaccination showed improvement clinically.', 'The yellowish elevated lesion at the fovea had reduced in size, corresponding to the reported improvement in symptoms.', 'The lesion from OCT was still present.', 'There was hyperfluroescence at the macula in venous phase of FFA and hypocyanescence at the macula on ICGA.']\n\nPatient: That's reassuring to hear that there's been some improvement. Should I be doing anything specific to help this process along?Doctor: ['(A)Ocular imaging, including spectral-domain OCT, fundus photography, and autofluorescence, was obtained via Heidelberg Spectralis®HRA+OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), which showed a dome-shaped hyper-reflective elevation at the left fovea involving the photoreceptor layer and causing disruption of the ellipsoid zone.']\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: ['(A)Fundus autofluorescence showed hyperautofluorescence at the foveal region that corresponded clinically to the location where the yellowish-white lesion was observed at the macula (Figure 1A).']\n\nPatient: I did notice a slight change in my central vision. Is this something serious?\n\nDoctor: ['(A)These findings were suggestive of acute retinal pigment epithelitis (ARPE).']\n\nPatient: I see. Is this something that will resolve on its own, or will I need treatment?Doctor: ['We diagnosed his ocular symptoms as possibly vaccine-related, and our patient subsequently opted not to continue with the second dose of his vaccine.”']\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.",
    "Case 2": "\n        Doctor: Hi! How are you feeling today?\n        Patient: Hi, doctor. I’m feeling a bit better, but I still have some concerns.\n\n        Doctor: I see, Could you please share a little about yourself, and if you have any medical conditions or allergies?\n        Patient: ['A 68-year-old Malay man.']\n        Doctor: Can you describe when you first experienced any issues with your vision after the vaccination?\n\nPatient: ['A 68-year-old Malay man presented with sudden-onset right-eye central blurring of vision 3 days after receiving his second dose of COVID-19 vaccination (Cominarty, BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech).']\n\nDoctor: Did you have any similar symptoms after receiving your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nPatient: ['He did not have any ocular symptoms after his first dose of the vaccine.']\n\nDoctor: Do you have any previous eye conditions or other medical illnesses that could be related to this recent experience?\n\nPatient: ['He had no underlying medical illness and no significant past ocular history.']Doctor: Could you tell me about any medical conditions or history with your eyes that might be relevant?  \nPatient: ['He had no underlying medical illness and no significant past ocular history.']Doctor: ['Ocular coherence tomography (Topcon Spectral Domain OCT) showed loss of foveal contour with the presence of intraretinal and subretinal fluid, and a fibrovascular pigment epithelial defect (Figure 2A).']\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: ['OCT macula revealed resolution of intraretinal fluids; however, the subretinal fluid was similar in size and the fibrovascular PED was more defined (Figure 2B).']\n\nPatient: It’s a relief to hear some things are improving, but should I be worried about the subretinal fluid or the more defined defect?Doctor: ['His presenting visual acuity was 6/12 OD and 6/6 OS.','The anterior segment examination was unremarkable.','Fundus examination showed an orange-round lesion at the macula.','There was no drusen or evidence of age-related macular degeneration, and no myopic changes.','Examination of the posterior segment showed hemorrhagic changes at the macula.']\n\nPatient: Alright, I understand. Can you tell me what this might mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: The presence of an 'orange-round lesion at the macula' and 'hemorrhagic changes at the macula' could be impacting your vision in the right eye, which is why the visual acuity is 6/12 OD. \n\nPatient: That makes sense. Is this something that could get worse over time?\n\nDoctor: Given that there was 'no drusen or evidence of age-related macular degeneration, and no myopic changes', it appears that the issue isn't related to those common conditions. However, monitoring the lesion and hemorrhagic changes is important to prevent any potential worsening.\n\nPatient: I see. What steps can we take to monitor or treat it?\n\nDoctor: Further evaluation and possibly imaging studies might help us understand the nature and cause of the 'orange-round lesion' and the 'hemorrhagic changes'. This will inform any treatment options or need for frequent monitoring.\n\nPatient: Thanks for explaining. Let's proceed with the necessary next steps.Doctor: ['He had no underlying medical illness and no significant past ocular history.']\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.",

What does that mean for my vision?\n\nDoctor: ['(B)Fundus photo and OCT macula showing resolution of bilateral placoid lesions and macula edema one week post-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone.']  \nPatient: That's a relief to hear. So the treatment is working well, then?Doctor: ['Posterior segment examination showed bilateral fibrinous placoid lesions in the choroid with severe inner and outer macula edema (Figure\\xa03A).']\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. Can you tell me more about what this means for my vision?Doctor: ['A diagnosis of acute multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy was made based on clinical and investigational findings.”']\nPatient: Will do. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns.",
